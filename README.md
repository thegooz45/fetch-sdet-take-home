# fetch-sdet-take-home

## what's the goal?
write a command line utility that, given a city, state, or zip code, returns the latitude, longitude, place, name, and other necessary info

## what language is this all done in?
python! and tested with pytest

## how do i run this?

### make sure your python is to the latest! i'm using python 3.6

1. clone this repo
2. create the venv
`python -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
3. install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. install the package
`pip install .`

and then to run the tests, something like `python tests/` works!

as always, have a great day! (✿◠‿◠)
